### About the Template

The Pygame-Template is a prime starting point for projects using the Pygame library, well-suited for 2D game development and other graphical applications. It offers an efficient setup process and a well-organized project structure, tailored specifically for Python developers.

### Repository Structure

- **src/**: Houses the runnable `main.py` and other main source files of your Pygame application, organized for easy development.
- **lib/**: Stores any additional libraries and dependencies required by your project.
- **assets/**: Contains folders for organizing graphics, audio, and other media files used in the game.
- **config/**: Configuration files for setting up game parameters and options.
- **bin/**: Holds compiled Python files or executables, including outputs from the build process.
- **build/**: Used for storing files generated during the build process.
- **data/**: Includes essential game data files such as level designs, configuration data, or scripts.
- **docs/**: For all project documentation, such as developer guides, Game Design Documents, and other useful resources.
- **tests/**: Contains all testing scripts and files, including unit and integration tests.
- **tools/**: Various scripts or utilities for tasks like building, deploying, or automating aspects of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python package dependencies for the project.
- **pyproject.toml** and **poetry.lock**: Used for managing project dependencies and settings with Poetry.
- **replit.nix**: Special file for Replit configuration, facilitating integration with the Replit environment.
- **LICENSE**: The licensing information for your project.
